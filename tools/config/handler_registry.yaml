# Section Handler Registry
# Maps (doc_type, section_id) -> handler configuration
# This decouples section processing logic from code, allowing new document types
# and section behaviors to be defined via YAML configuration without engine changes.

# Handler Modes:
#   - integrate_then_questions: Default mode (current phase1/phase2 behavior)
#       * If section has answered questions → integrate answers via LLM
#       * If section still blank after integration → generate new questions
#       * If section has open questions but no answers → skip (blocked)
#   - questions_then_integrate: Alternative mode (future use)
#       * If section blank and no questions → generate questions
#       * If section has answered questions → integrate answers
#       * Never generate questions after integration (single pass)
#   - review_gate: Special mode for review gates (Issue 7)
#       * LLM reviews specified scope (prior sections or current)
#       * Returns pass/fail + optional patches
#       * No direct document mutation

# Output Formats:
#   - prose: Paragraph format (default)
#   - bullets: Bullet list format
#   - subsections: Preserve subsection headers (e.g., ### Technical Constraints)

# Scope Values:
#   - current_section: Process/review only the current section
#   - all_prior_sections: Review all sections before this gate (for review_gate mode)
