# Test Artifacts Directory

## Purpose

This directory stores all test execution artifacts generated by the Testing Agent, including test run reports, screenshots, videos, logs, performance reports, and other evidence collected during test execution.

## Directory Structure

```

**Examples:**
- `TR-2026-02-15-001/screenshots/E2E-001-step-1.png`
- `TR-2026-02-15-001/videos/E2E-001-full-flow.mp4`
- `TR-2026-02-15-001/logs/INT-001-execution.log`
- `TR-2026-02-15-001/performance/PERF-001-performance-report.html`

## Naming Convention

**Test Run ID Format:** `TR-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN`
- TR = Test Run prefix
- YYYY-MM-DD = Execution date
- NNN = Sequential number for that day (001, 002, etc.)

**Artifact File Names:**
- Include test case ID as prefix (e.g., `E2E-001-`)
- Use descriptive names indicating content
- Use hyphens for multi-word names
- Include step numbers for sequential captures (e.g., `-step-1`)
- Use standard formats: PNG for images, MP4 for videos, LOG/TXT for logs, HTML for reports

## Test Run Index

<!-- Maintained by Testing Agent -->

| Test Run ID | Issue | Execution Date | Status | Test Report | Key Artifacts |
|-------------|-------|----------------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| [TR-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN] | [M1-I1] | [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] | [✅ Pass / ❌ Fail / ⚠️ Blocked] | [Link to test-report.md] | [Count: X screenshots, Y videos, Z logs] |
| [TR-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN] | [M1-I2] | [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] | [Status] | [Link] | [Artifacts count] |

## Artifact Types

### Screenshots
Static images captured during test execution showing UI state, error messages, success states, and other visual evidence.

**Usage:** Evidence for manual and automated UI tests

### Videos
Screen recordings of complete user flows and test executions.

**Usage:** Complex flows, bug reproduction, user journey documentation

### Logs
Text files containing detailed execution logs, error messages, stack traces, and debugging information.

**Usage:** Failure analysis, debugging, audit trail

### Performance Reports
HTML reports and JSON data from performance testing tools showing response times, throughput, resource usage, and load test results.

**Usage:** Performance validation, bottleneck identification, trend analysis

### Security Scan Results
Reports from security testing tools showing vulnerability scans, penetration test results, and security compliance checks.

**Usage:** Security validation, vulnerability tracking, compliance evidence

### Accessibility Reports
Reports from accessibility testing tools showing WCAG compliance, screen reader compatibility, and keyboard navigation validation.

**Usage:** Accessibility validation, compliance evidence, remediation guidance

## Retention Policy

1. **Active test runs:** Keep all artifacts for current milestone
2. **Completed milestones:** Archive artifacts but keep test reports indefinitely
3. **Failed tests:** Retain artifacts until defects are resolved and retested
4. **Passed tests:** May archive older passing test artifacts after milestone completion
5. **Critical evidence:** Never delete artifacts that document security or compliance issues

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Automatic capture:** Testing Agent should automatically capture evidence during test execution
2. **Comprehensive evidence:** Include enough evidence to reproduce and understand any failures
3. **Organized storage:** Follow directory structure and naming conventions strictly
4. **Reference in reports:** All artifacts must be referenced in test-results.md
5. **Access control:** Read access for all agents, write access only for Testing Agent

## Cross-References

- **Test Results Report:** `/reporting/test-results.md` - References artifacts stored here
- **Test Specification:** `/docs/test-spec.md` - Defines tests that generate these artifacts
- **Milestone Summary:** `/reporting/milestone-execution-summary.md` - Summarizes test results
- **Implementation Notes:** `/docs/implementation-notes.md` - May reference artifacts for defect analysis
